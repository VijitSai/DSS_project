# DSS_project
As a part of assignment we designed a DSS to assign risk weight to each of the state in USA based on different criteria



## Preprocessing:
- using Covid19_Hospital_Data_Coverage dataset created a new csv hospital count which contains the count of hospital in each state
- Data consisted of 15 unique parameters. Hence, Pandas and Mongo DB was used.
## To keep in mind:
- The dataset Covid19_Hospital_Data_Coverage has also types of hospital(short term, long term, critical care) etc (did not include in this project)
-
